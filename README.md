## ` PROBLEM STATEMENT : `
Chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease are major health problems worldwide. 
Early detection and diagnosis of chronic diseases can greatly improve the chances of successful treatment 
and management of these conditions.However, traditional diagnosis methods are often costly, time-consuming, 
and invasive, making them impractical for widespread screening of populations.
Therefore, there exist a need for a predictive model that can accurately predict the risk of developing 
chronic diseases based on various risk factors such as age, gender and medical history.

<br /><br />

## ` SOLUTION : `
H-oracle is a webapp that can predict how prone a person is to a chronic disease. This wil help in early 
detection and diagnosis of such diseases and improve the chances of a successful treatment.
Chronic diseases include heart problems, diabetes, hypertension and so on. For each disease we intend to 
develop an ML model that can predict if a person is prone depending on data such as age, gender and certain 
medical parameters. Based on the prediction from this application the, user is given the knowledge of which 
specialist to consult. 
We aim to become an asistant to doctors and other medical staff

Presently we have 2 models:
1. Predicting Heart problems
2. Predicting Diabetes

FURTHER Implemetation

More models covering diseaes like hypertension, Cancer, Kidney issues and so on
Improve accuracy of models using more training data, features and better classification algorithms that fit the data
